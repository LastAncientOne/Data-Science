# Data Science  
This a practice of writing codes using kaggle data and real world data. In addition, is to learn to be a data scientists and expanding more knowledge in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding data and analyzing data.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.5  

R 3.5.3   

Excel 2016  

Power BI

# &#x1F537; Getting Started with Data Science &#x1F537;
### &#x1F535; Step-by-Step to Data Science  
* Define Problem  
* Data Collection  
* Data Understanding    
* Data Analysis/Cleaning  
* Data Organization/Transformation  
* Data Validation/Anomaly Detection  
* Feature Engineering  
* Model Training  
* Model Evaluation/validation  
* Model Monitoring  
* Model Deployment  
* Data Drift/Model Drift  
* Reports  
### &#x1F535; Three Types of Position in Data Science  
* Data Engineer  
  - Develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scales processing systems.  
* Data Analyst  
  - Interprets data and turns data into information which can offer ways to improve business.  
  - Gather information from various sources and intrepret patterns and trends.  
* Machine Learning Scientist  
  - Research and developed algorithms.  
  - Predictions from data with labels and features.  
  - Create a predictive models.  
  
### &#x1F535; Two Types of Data  
* Supervised Data (Data pre-categorized or numerical)  
  - Classification (Predict a category)  
  - Regression (Predict a number)  
* Unsupervised Data (Data is not labeled in any way)  
  - Clustering (Divide by similarity)  
  - Dimension Reduction (Generalization) - Find hidden dependencies    
  - Association (Identify Sequences)       
### &#x1F535; Learning about Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Import, clean, and validate  
  - Define Variables
    1. Y is "Dependent Variable" and goes on x-axis (the bottom, horizontal one) - output value
    2. X is "Independent Variable" and goes on the y-axis (the left side, vertical one) - input value
  - Type of Data  
    1. Quantitative
      - Ratio or Interval
        - Discrete and Continuous  
        Discrete variables can only take certain numerical values and are counted  
        Continuous variables can take any numerical value and are measured
    2. Qualitative  
      - Norminal or Ordinal
        - Binary, nominal data, and ordinal data  
        Categorical variables take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups.
  - Type of data measurements 
    1. Nominal - names or labels variable
    2. Ordinal - non-numeric concepts like satisfaction, happiness, discomfort, etc.
    3. Interval - numeric scales in which we know both the order and the exact differences between the values
    4. Ratio - measurement scales
    
* Visualize distributions  
  - Univariate visualization  
  - Bivariate visualization  
  - Multivariate visualization  
  - Dimensionality reduction  
* Explore relations between variables
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Inferential statistics  
  - Statistical graphics  
* Explore multivariate relationships  
* Statistical Analysis
  - Cases, Variables, Types of Variables  
  - Matrix and Frequency Table  
  - Graphs and Shapes of Distributions  
  - Mode, Median and Mean  
  - Range, Interquartile Range and Box Plot  
  - Variance and Standard deviation  
  - Z-scores  
  - Contingency Table, Scatterplot, Pearsonâ€™s   
  - Basics of Regression  
  - Elementary Probability  
  - Random Variables and Probability Distributions  
  - Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution & Poisson Distribution  
* Inferential Statistics  
  - Observational Studies and Experiments  
  - Sample and Population  
  - Population Distribution, Sample Distribution and Sampling Distribution  
  - Central Limit Theorem  
  - Point Estimates  
  - Confidence Intervals  
  - Introduction to Hypothesis Testing  
* Questions about data  
  - Do you have the right data for exploratory data anlaysis?  
  - Do you need other data?  
  - Do you have the right question?  
### &#x1F535; Learning to be Data Science  
* Choose Programming Language  
  - Python or R  
* Mathematics and Linear Algebra  
* Big Data  
* Data Visualization  
* Data Cleaning
* How to solve Problem?
* Machine Learning
  - Type of algorithms performs the learning  
  1. Supervised Learning
    - Dataset has labels
    * Classification    
      - Binary Classification  
      - Multiclass Classification  
      - Multilabel Classification  
    * Regression  
      - Linear Regression: Linear relationships between inputs and outputs  
      - Logistic Regression: Probability of a binary output  
  2. Unsupervised Learning    
    - Dataset is unlabeled
  3. Semi-supervised Learning 
    - Dataset contains labeled and unlabeled
  4. Reinforcement Learning  
    - Learns from mistakes
    - Agent take "actions" in an environment and see the "state" of environment with the features
    - Excute actions in every state with different actions bring different "rewards"
    - It learns "policy".
