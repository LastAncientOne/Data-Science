# Data Science  
This a practice of writing codes using kaggle data and real world data. Learning step-by-step in analyzing data in python, R, Excel, and Power BI. In addition, is to learn to be a data scientists and expanding more knowledge in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding data and analyzing data.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.5  

R 3.5.3   

Excel 2016  

Power BI

# &#x1F537; Getting Started with Data Science &#x1F537;
### &#x1F535; Step-by-Step to Data Science  
* Define Problem  
* Data Collection  
* Data Understanding    
* Data Analysis/Cleaning  
* Data Organization/Transformation  
* Data Validation/Anomaly Detection  
* Feature Engineering  
* Model Training  
* Model Evaluation/validation  
* Model Monitoring  
* Model Deployment  
* Data Drift/Model Drift  
* Reports  
### &#x1F535; Three Types of Position in Data Science  
* Data Engineer  
  - Develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scales processing systems.  
* Data Analyst  
  - Interprets data and turns data into information which can offer ways to improve business.  
  - Gather information from various sources and intrepret patterns and trends.  
* Machine Learning Scientist  
  - Research and developed algorithms.  
  - Predictions from data with labels and features.  
  - Create a predictive models.  

### &#x1F535; Types of Data Analysis: Techniques and Methods  
* Descriptive Analysis  
* Text Analysis  
* Statistical Analysis  
* Diagnostic Analysis  
* Predictive Analysis  
* Prescriptive Analysis   
  
### &#x1F535; Two Types of Data  
* Supervised Data (Data pre-categorized or numerical)  
  - Classification (Predict a category)  
  - Regression (Predict a number)  
* Unsupervised Data (Data is not labeled in any way)  
  - Clustering (Divide by similarity)  
  - Dimension Reduction (Generalization) - Find hidden dependencies    
  - Association (Identify Sequences)       
### &#x1F535; Learning about Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Import, clean, and validate  
  - Define Variables
    1. Y is "Dependent Variable" and goes on y-axis (the left side, vertical one) - output value
    2. X is "Independent Variable" and goes on the x-axis (the bottom, horizontal one) - input value
  - Type of Data  
    1. Quantitative
      - Ratio or Interval
        - Discrete and Continuous  
        Discrete variables can only take certain numerical values and are counted  
        Continuous variables can take any numerical value and are measured
    2. Qualitative  
      - Norminal or Ordinal
        - Binary, nominal data, and ordinal data  
        Categorical variables take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups.
  - Type of data measurements 
    1. Nominal - names or labels variable  
    For example, gender: male and female. Other examples include eye colour and hair colour.  
    2. Ordinal - non-numeric concepts like satisfaction, happiness, discomfort, etc.  
    For example: is rating happiness on a scale of 1-10.  
    3. Interval - numeric scales in which we know both the order and the exact differences between the values  
    For example: interval data is temperature, the difference in temperature between 10-20 degrees is the same as the difference in temperature between 20-30 degrees.  Likert scale is type of data. Likert scale is composed of a series of four or more Likert-type items that represent similar questions combined into a single composite score/variable. Likert scale data can be analyzed as interval data, i.e. the mean is the best measure of central tendency. use means and standard deviations to describe the scale. For example, it is a rating scale, often found on survey forms, that measures how people feel about something. It includes a series of questions that you ask people to answer, and ideally 5-7 balanced responses people can choose from. It often comes with a neutral midpoint.  
    4. Ratio - measurement scales  
    For example: data it must have a true zero, meaning it is not possible to have negative values in ratio data. Ratio data is measurements of height be that centimetres, metres, inches or feet.
