# Kaggle-Project  
This a practice of writing codes using kaggle data and real world data. Also, is to learn to be a data scientists and expanding more knowledge in machine learning and deep learning.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.5

R 3.5.3 

# &#x1F537; Getting Started with Data Science &#x1F537;
### &#x1F535; Three Types of Position in Data Science  
* Data Engineer  
  - Develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scales processing systems.  
* Data Analyst  
  - Interprets data and turns data into information which can offer ways to improve business.  
  - Gather information from various sources and intrepret patterns and trends.  
* Machine Learning Scientist  
  - Research and developed algorithms.  
  - Predictions from data with labels and features.  
  - Create a predictive models.  
### &#x1F535; Learning about Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Import, clean, and validate  
  - Type of Data  
    1. Qualitative  
        - Discrete and Continuous  
    2. Quantitative   
        - Binary, nominal data, and ordinal data  
  - Type of data measusrements  
    1. Nominal  
    2. Ordinal  
    3. Interval  
* Visualize distributions  
  - Univariate visualization  
  - Bivariate visualization  
  - Multivariate visualization  
  - Dimensionality reduction  
* Explore relations between variables
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Inferential statistics  
  - Statistical graphics  
* Explore multivariate relationships  
* Questions about data  
  - Do you have the right data for exploratory data anlaysis?  
  - Do you need other data?
  - Do you have the right question
### &#x1F535; Learning to be Data Science  
* Choose Programming Language  
  - Python or R  
* Mathematics and Linear Algebra  
* Big Data  
* Data Visualization  
* Data Cleaning
* How to solve Problem?
* Machine Learning
  - Type of algorithms performs the learning  
  1. Supervised Learning
    - Dataset has labels
    * Classification    
      - Binary Classification  
      - Multiclass Classification  
      - Multilabel Classification  
    * Regression  
      - Linear Regression: Linear relationships between inputs and outputs  
      - Logistic Regression: Probability of a binary output  
  2. Unsupervised Learning    
    - Dataset is unlabeled
  3. Semi-supervised Learning 
    - Dataset contains labeled and unlabeled
  4. Reinforcement Learning  
    - Learns from mistakes
    - Agent take "actions" in an enviornment and see the "state" of envirnomentwith the fetaures
    - Excute actions in every state with different actions bring different "rewards"
    - It learns "policy".
 - Common Machine Learning Algorithms
  1. Linear Regression  
  2. Logistic Regression  
  3. Decision Tree  
  4. SVM  
  5. Naive Bayes  
  6. kNN  
  7. K-Means  
  8. Random Forest  
  9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms  
  10. Gradient Boosting algorithms  
* Deep Learning
  - Common Library
  1. TensorFlow  
  2. Keras  
  3. Theano  
  4. Pytorch  
  5. sklearn  
  6. Caffe  
### &#x1F535; Learning to improve the Model or Prediction
  - Improve the "Accuracy" of Machine Learning Model  
  1. Add More Data
  2. Add More Features
  3. Feature Engineering  
  4. Feature Selection  
  5. Use Regularization  
  6. Multiple Alogrithms  
  7. Ensemble Methods  
  8. Cross Validation  
  9. Algorithm Tuning
  10.  Bagging or Boosting
